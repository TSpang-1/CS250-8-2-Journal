--- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? ---
To properly interpret the user needs, I start by listening to what the client or product owner wants to accomplish rather than just focusing on the technical details first. For the SNHU Travel project, I identified the company's goal of creating a booking tool that has a strong focus on health and wellness traveling. From here, I turned these user goals into user stories that have a short description of what the users should be able to do and why. 

--- How does creating “user stories” help with this? --- 
User stories makes it a lot easier to see the system from the user's perspective instead of list of features. They also help the development teams to stay focused on what is the most valuable to the customer. By breaking larger goals into smaller and clearer user stories, I was able to design features that support what the users actually needed directly. 

--- How do I approach developing programs? ---
When developing any program, I like to start small and build everything in single steps. The Agile approach fits perfectly with this since it focuses on short and manageable sprints where we can plan, build, test, and review before moving forward with the project. This method helped me and my SNHU Travel team to adjust quickly when the product owner changed the product's focus to health and wellness traveling without having to start the entire project over from the beginning. 

--- What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? ---
In the future, I plan to keep using the Agile practices like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. These processes help to keep communication open and makes it easier to adapt to changes which is definitely important in real-world software devleopment. 

--- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? ---
Being a good team member means much more than just writing good code. It is about communication, accountability, and collaboration. On the SNHU Travel, everyone, from the product owner to the developers and testers, needed to stay connected with each other and remain clear with both their progress and challenges. I learned that offering help, asking questions early on, and respecting each person's role made the project go much more smoothly. Good teamwork ensures that everyone understands how their contributions fit into the big picture which leads to a stronger final product and a better experience for the client.
